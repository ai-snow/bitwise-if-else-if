# bitwise-if-else-if
An example of constructing if-else-if logic in bitwise operations.

# Posed Question
Say you have a byte (8 bits) coming into your system that has certain bits set to indicate a specific behavior.  You know which combination of bits lead to which behavior.  If the separate behaviors can be stored in an array, how can you figure out which index to the array to use for a given incoming byte USING ONLY BITWISE OPERATORS AND +/-?

# Solution
See: main.py
